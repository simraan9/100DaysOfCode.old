# 100DaysOfCode : AgentDummy

Agent Dummy is a simulation of a being left in an environment with other objects it can interact with. Soon to be autonomous some day, Dummy came into existence as our understanding of Object Oriented Programming, from p5Js to OpenFrameworks. Every day, it learns a little more as we learn a little more ourselves.

The project is a brain-child of Apoorva (@apoorva-a98) and Simran (@simraan9); mentored, encouraged and supported by Gaurav (@0xf17)
